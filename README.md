# DailyTree

DailyTree provides the user with a formatted menu containing 50 trees with their scientific name, common name and an index number.  It then prompts the user to enter the index of the plant they would like to learn more information on and returns a list of all those attributes, and repeats this step until the user types ‘exit’.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'daily_tree'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install daily_tree

## Usage

To run this gem enter 'ruby ./bin/daily-tree' in the command line then follow the prompts.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
